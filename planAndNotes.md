# Points to consider:
- Responsive design (start building mobile view first)
- Accessibility (colors, buttons, arias, etc) 
- User experience (simple flow)
- Reusable components (button, card possibly?)
-Small deliverables for rapid release (MVP)


## PLAN
- DONE - Do research and tutorials on Angular to get a sense of the new framework and have a simple project to reference.
- Do research into boostrap as this will affect the direction of the design 
- play around in repo to see how it' fitting together
- Check boostrap setup in repo (ref here https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-bootstrap-css-framework-to-an-angular-application/)
- Build simple prototype to test whether I've got enough understanding to get going
- Wireframe
- Component tree
- Data flow diagram 
- DONE - Set up router
- UiService
- Conditional formatting 
- Pagination for display https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov9UqIEa8Zs
