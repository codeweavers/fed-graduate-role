# Pok√©API Directory 

## Prerequisite
This task needs to be completed using both Angular and Bootstrap (already included in package.json).  

You can install additional packages if you desire.

There are no wireframes or designs attached, use your own creative flair!

## Brief
Using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) we would like you to create a Pok√©mon directory allowing users to browse all available Pok√©mon.

### Minimum Requirements
Build an SPA to list all available Pok√©mon and view each in greater detail.

#### Step 1
 Use the [GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon) to build a page that will list all available Pok√©mon.
 
_**Hint**: This API can be called without an `{id or name}` to return a paginated resource list, see more information on that [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#resource-listspagination-section)._

- This page should allow the user to navigate through the result in blocks of 50.
- This page should be reloadable and shareable. For example, sharing or reloading `https://myapp.co.uk/pokemon-directory?page=4` should hydrate the UI correctly showing the Pok√©mon results 150-200.

#### Step 2
Use the [GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon) to build a page displaying information about the Pok√©mon.
- This page should be accessed by clicking a Pok√©mon result from step 1.
- This page should be reloadable and shareable. For example, sharing or reloading `https://myapp.co.uk/pokemon/{id}` should hydrate the UI correctly with the details for the Pok√©mons ID in the app URL.

### Non Mandatory Requirements
If you're enjoying the task and want to show off, use any other additional Pok√©API(s) to add more functionality and/or information to your application. 


### Getting Started
#### Install Dependencies
`npm install`
#### Serve Project
`ng serve`

This is the easiest way to run and develop your app locally.

# Martha's Notes

    üëÄ = doing
    ‚úÖ = done
    ü§î = curious/question for CWs/find out more
    üõéÔ∏è = take note, Martha!

## Process (5/4/23)

### AM

### Read through README ‚úÖ
- What does 'hydrate' mean? ü§î 
- What other Pok√©mon APIs are out there? ü§î 

### Set up folders in GitHub + VS Code ‚úÖ

### Read through Pok√©API documentation ‚úÖ
- What's a Wrapper Library? Creates a simple interface. 
- üõéÔ∏è This could be handy for making sure there are 50 results on each page. Resources List/Pagination: 'If you would like to change this just add a 'limit' query parameter to the GET request, e.g. ?limit=60. You can use 'offset' to move to the next page, e.g. ?limit=60&offset=60.'
- üõéÔ∏è Potential additional functionality with Abilities: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ability

### Research Pok√©dex ‚úÖ
- Basically, a Pok√©mon database (as I thought!). Interesting that they have 'Total' points

### Research TypeScript ‚úÖ
- Have studied a little bit on SoC bootcamp
- Compiler can catch bugs in advance
- Superset of JS
- Installing the dependencies (red squiggles have disappeared) 
- This is the version of JS it's targeting: ES2022
- Added '"watch": true,' to tsconfig.json (recompiles the code every time we save the file, means I don't have to use the 'tsc' command in the temrinal after every change)
- 2x ways you can strong-type your code: implicitly or explicitly. 
- Don't add notation that is redundant e.g. `let lucky: number = 23;`
- You can also add your own types (typically in Pascal case) 
- In TS, we can enforce the shape of an object with an interface
- Strong-typing a function can be a little more complex. 
- 'void' common as a type for Event Listeners 
- Strong-typing an array 
- 'Twople'? Have not come across this before. It's a fixed-length array where each item has a fixed type. 
- Can use '?' in TS to make values optional e.g. `type MyList = [number?, string?, boolean?]` Can also use to make function arguments optional
- TS generics = lets us specify type for later on in our code e.g. `class Observable<T> {`

 ### Research Angular ‚úÖ
 - UI framework, maintained by Google
 - Component-based for building scalable apps
 - Provides collection of libraries to cover Routing + Forms e.g. React
 - Research more, M? ü§î

 ### Research Bootstrap ‚úÖ
 - CSS framework: the most popular one 
 - Bootstrap is already installed
 - Opened with Live Server and it works! (Not in default Bootstrap font, however)
 - Deviated from YouTube intro to look up Bootstrap docs. Have simplified stylesheet bit and it's now in the Bootstrap font with no errors
 - I needed to import the scripts into the HTML, I think, which I've now done. Great! No errors.
 - Have used Inspect --> Network for the 1st time and can see that popper.js is being loaded, too (do I need this? Didn't see it in the dependencies but have added, just in case ü§î)
 - Grid system (watching demo)
 - Content adjusts to screen size (don't need different versions for different devices)
 - Can see what it looks like in the Web developer section
 - Within each Row, you have 12x units
 - xl xxl etc. means the screen size
 - Breakpoints - comes with 6 predefined breakpoints (but you can customise them - but not v wise)
 - 3x elements: container, row + column
 - Has margins. If you want the column to span the whole width, use `class="container-fluid border"`
 - Or, if you want to mix it, you can use `class="container-md border"` (creates a min. width it will span across)
 - Rows = not much you can change about these
 - `.col` creates a column div
 - I can now add rows and columns!
 - How can I create columns of a set size and breakpoint? E.g `class="col-lg-8 col-md-6"`

 ### PM 
 - Have come back after lunch and am thinking it would be wise to focus on my MVP + wireframe and come back to the Bootleg tutorial once I need it in more granular detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qfEOE4vtxE

 ### What is my MVP? ‚úÖ
 Step 1: Build a page to display all available Pok√©mon using the GET request. User should be able to navigate through the result in blocks of 50 (see earlier notes re: Pagination). The page must be reloadable and shareable (e.g. https://myapp.co.uk/pokemon-directory?page=4 should hydrate the UI correctly showing the Pok√©mon results 150-200)
 1. I need to build a page that displays all of the Pok√©mon. 

 Step 2: Build a page displaying information about the Pok√©mon using the GET request. This should be accessed by clicking a Pok√©mon result from Step 1. This page should be reloadable and shareable (e.g. https://myapp.co.uk/pokemon/{id} should hydrate the UI correctly with the details for the Pok√©mon ID in the app URL)

 It would be fun to display this in a Pok√©dex-style format. How do I do this? ü§î 

 Stretch Goals: Add more functionality/information to the app using additional Pok√©APIs. Write a couple of tests! 

 Process:
 - I'm going to make a low-fidelity wireframe for Steps 1 + 2 in Figma, as I feel this could retrospectively inform what my MVP is. 

 ### Make Wireframe ‚úÖ
 - In Figma. Initially using laptop-sized screen for maximum space, but keeping mobile-size in mind.
 - Going to look up Pok√©mon styling. Pok√©dex is a very specific shape. Think more of a basic grid system would be good for Step 1, however. 
 - üõéÔ∏è Found Or-Yam's Pok√©dex on CodePen - could be a good reference point for Step 2? https://dev.to/oryam/css-pokedex-3iln
 - Ok, have made Low-Fidelity Wireframes for Steps 1 + 2 (found in 'src/images...')


## Process (6/4/23) 

### AM

### Continuation from Yesterday:
- Could be helpful to build a component tree? Use Miro, perhaps?
- Maybe I could divide into tickets on a Trello board? (Will see how pushed for time/how many threads I need to keep count of)

### Revise CRUD principles

### Start experimenting with Pok√©APi
- Spend more time researching Angular - should I be using React? If so, why? `npm start`... (see 'Deeper-dive' below) ‚úÖ
- Try out GET request in Postman - check all is working as expected ‚úÖ (Not quite as expected: can display default 20 or change to 50 Pok√©mon (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/, https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=50&limit=50) but this endpoint doesn't seem to be working: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name})
- Continue Bootstrap building tutorial (using appropriate chapters: not all is applicable for MVP)

### Deeper-dive into Angular setup and creating Headers ‚úÖ
- Right, going back to Angular docs, I have npm version 8.19.2 ah. I need at least version 8.5.0 to create an Angular app. So, I need to update Node. ‚úÖ
- Going to follow the docs. npm version is now 9.5.0
- I'm a bit confused as to how much has already been made, so I'm going to follow the docs to make a new Angular app and see if/where crossover
- Have created a new app in 'src' called 'Pokedex' (couldn't put the accent on the 'e'!) ERROR message: 'this command is not available when running the Angular CLI inside a workspace'. I might try to install it a bit further up, see if that helps.
- Tried to install in 'fed-graduate-role' but same ERROR - maybe it's already installed?
- Ok, skipped that bit and cd-ed into 'app', ran `npm start` and it compiled successfully - hooray!
- ERROR 'app-header is not a known element'. Do I need to cd up? No. Have c'd out and will npm start again. Still an issue with that component. Will remove it and try steps again
- I just removed it from app.component.html and it is now compiling successfully - but is this what I need? Don't think so. 
- Looking at Angular docs, `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` is a defauly placeholder. Does this mean I need to replace it/keep it? No, it doesn't like `<app-header></app-header>`
- I'm not getting anywhere, so I'll look up how to make components in Angular.
- I'm following tutorials, typing in 'ng g c header' to the terminal but it's not working - will visit Stack Overflow
- No joy, so am going back to Angular docs and am having a go at following a YouTube tutorial so I can at least make an Angular app... it worked creating the 'Pokedex' app this time because I positioned it in the 'Codeweavers' file, rather than lower down. 
- As with the first example, ERROR message = `ng serve --open` 'ng: command not found' so looks like something to do with ng on my computer... will investigate.
- Ok, I think I now have Angular set up (found this helpful: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58138138/angular-cli-ng-command-not-found-on-mac-os) BUT have this ERROR message: 'Warning: The current version of Node (19.8.1) is not supported by Angular'. Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69090357/ng-version-showing-the-current-version-of-node-16-8-0-is-not-supported-by-an. Also looked at: https://unpkg.com/browse/@angular/core@15.2.5/package.json
- Ok, in 'Pokedex', have run `ng serve` and all seems to working ok: 'Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200...'
- Yay! For the first time, the Angular content is showing up - I've hopefully gotten over this hump üê™!
- It says I don't have permission: ERROR "! If you believe this might be a permissions issue, please double-check the permissions of the file and its containing directories, or try running the command again as root/Administrator.
- reading Stack Overflow docs, have tried `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli` and it looks like it worked. 
- `ng help` now works, at least! Progress!
- ok, I still want to make a Header - let's see how this goes... `ng g c header --skipTests`
- same ERROR as before: 'This command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace' - do I need to do this in 'app' then?
- üéâüéâüéâ FINALLY DID IT!!! `ng g c header` üéâüéâüéâ (maybe I just didn't have permission? Also, it didn't like the 'skipTests' bit)
- Ok, can I do this in the 'fed-graduate-role' file, too? Will try - YES!!
- Back to 'Pokedex' file to continue test set-up. The browser is getting confused with the two apps - maybe I'll move/delete the test app (as 'fed...' seems to be working ok now 
- YAY it's now working on port 4200 
- I think because I've already imported Bootstrap, It's not showing up the Header. In future projects, I'll get Angular set up first!
- I've commented out Bootstrap, but the page is still not showing. WARNING in Console reads: 'non-JS module files deprecated.' 
- Have commented Bootstrap back in again...

## Process (8/4/23) 

### AM

### Continuation from 6/4/23: 
- Working on figuring out bugs that pop up in the console, e.g. ERROR 'The selector "app-root" did not match any elements'. Have done some research on Stack Overflow and Reddit and have found out it might be because there is an issue with the html structure (particularly as I'd already added Bootstrap into the mix... oops!). I have managed to make this ERROR message go away by calling the HTML "app-header" but have a new one: ERROR 'The selector "app-header" did not match any elements'. Ah, opk - that's the same ERROR, just a different flavour!
- Am going to try a different name, as perhaps it's getting muddied with the Bootstrap stuff. Will try "my-app". Same issue. Says it's a problem with line 7 of main.ts `.catch(err => console.error(err));`. Reading some info on Stack Overflow, I may get more info about the error if I don't use `.catch(err => console.error(err));`. Will give it a go
- Interesting: if I get rid of lines 6 and 7 from 'main.ts', the ERROR messages disappear - is this good?! ü§î I will stick a pin in here, as I'm not sure if getting rid of that was a good idea or not!

### Getting Data in Angular 
- Got a bit sidetracked looking up similarities between knitting and code!
- MUCH quicker at making compionents in Angular now!
- Still not showing what I need on the Live Server, so I tried to edit out all the Bootstrap stuff.
- ERROR 'src/app/services/data.service.ts:15:1 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'getPokemons'.' 
- Have looked back at code around this and can't see any bugs, will keep working on it
- Looks like an issue with 'data.service.ts'
- Tempted at this point to start again: may be quicker! 
- This time, I'll start with the Angular app and go from there (no Bootstrap till later!)
- I'll use what I've learned so far

### PM

- Restarting, as have got in a muddle with Angular + Bootstrap

## Process (11/4/23) 

### AM

- Picking up from where I left off - rebooting file to do the Angular bits first!
- Here we go :) 
- Angular already installed. Installed Node.
- `ng serve`
- Oh no - some of the same errors as before: had to delete some of the later additions in Angular, e.g. 'pokemon-list' and 'services'
- It's now working! Have compiled it successfully
- Ok, next bit - am setting up styling for componenets, but I can't see them on my Live Server. I suspect I've linked the wrong HTML file up (think it's using index.html) but I'm not sure how to fix this. I'm following a tutorial, so I'll see if there's a screenshot of their index.html I can suss out.
- Progressing and about to do the GET request, but Live Server is now not showing anything. WARNING message reads: 'crbug/1173575, non-JS module files deprecated. (anonymous) @ VM47:6750' - will Google what this means, as I've seen it before. It's something to do with old ways of testing... ok, have fixed this ERROR. I'm getting different ERRORS now at least! 
- Now reads: 'main.ts:6 ERROR RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded'. This ERROR occurs when there is an infinite loop (oops). Got rid of AppRouting component to see if that helps (it doesn't). I've found this on Stack Overflow: 

### Possible cases for this error which I found:

- 2 or more modules with the same name ‚úÖ (Think I've fixed this...)
- Wrong imports in your app.module.ts file ü§î (I'm not sure how to check these - will investigate)
- Problem with compilation (I will try this if the above fails!)

Solution that you can try:

- for point 1, change the names and make them unique ‚úÖ
- for point 2, make sure all imports are intended as per your use case for a module, do check for inter-dependency between modules ü§î üëÄ
- for point 3, rare but happens if browser doesn't have enough memory to process, so try to restart your code editor, browser or your PC. 

- Reading this article on component interdependence: https://lukeliutingchun.medium.com/angular-using-component-injection-to-communicate-between-parent-and-dynamic-child-components-99c1c297aa43

- How about using NgTemplateOutlet...? https://lukeliutingchun.medium.com/angular-using-ngtemplateoutlet-to-communicate-between-parent-and-dynamic-child-components-4d74ca9ba9b

- May work better as am using the Pok√©API? ü§î

### PM

- Watching a tutorial on NgTemplateOutlet - will see if this helps üòÇ
- Created a 'dev' branch to help me out if I need to reset/tweak further down the line (probably should have done this earlier...)
- Making 'Pokemon-list' component, then will go back to NgTemplateOutlet guidelines. 
- Same ERROR as before: 'RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded' (main.ts: 6 and 7) I will investigate these - see if anything can be done there...
- Oh yeah - that's just the general catch-all for if something goes wrong. How do I find out more specific info?
- ERROR message has gone and been replaced by '[webpack-dev-server] Server started: Hot Module Replacement disabled, Live Reloading enabled, Progress disabled, Overlay enabled.' in the console. What does this mean? ü§î Will look it up. Stack Overflow: "I'm not much understand how it works, I remove publicPath in webpack.config.js". Ok - will give this a go. Nope - too tricky! Will keep going with tutorials and see where I can get to.
- Back to setting up the Pok√©mon List - this way, I'll have at least a couple of components to try out with NGTemplateOutlet
- ERROR message has gone and it's compiling successfully, but still not showing the results of the Pok√©mon API...
- Still seems to be some sort of disconnect between the index.html and the app... will investigate.
- Will try approach 3 and turn everything off and back on again üòÇ
- Approach 3 did not work.
- Back to approach 2: trying to understand module interdependence 
- Going to check what original Angular app component was called to check I've not changed it to something odd
- Ohh - it's called 'app-root'. I'm going to change all instances of 'app-component' to 'app-root' and see if that helps. It's still not displaying on the Live Server, but at least I know it has the right name now - will remember this for future use.
- Watching a video about error handling in Angular - hopefully some similar errors to those I've come across will come up
- ü§î What's a 'standalone component'? (Just out of interest!)
- Stack Overflow. Following advice, it says "url": "http://localhost:9876/debug.html" in the launch.json - do I need to change this to localhost:4200? Hmm... going to try `ng test` in terminal. Ooh! Lots more information!
- Reading through more detailed info... 

Here are the 3 faults in more detail:

    1. Data Service = NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[DataService -> HttpClient -> HttpClient]: 
    NullInjectorError: No provider for HttpClient!

    2. Pokemon List Component = NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[DataService -> HttpClient -> HttpClient]: 
    NullInjectorError: No provider for HttpClient!

    3. Unexpected ng closing tag = Error: Errors during JIT compilation of template for HeaderComponent: Unexpected closing tag "-". It may happen when the tag has already been closed by another tag. For more info see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#closing-elements-that-have-implied-end-tags ("
`<h1>Pokedex App</h1>`
<div>class="pokedex-header"</div>
[ERROR ->]</->
</ng-template>"): ng:///HeaderComponent/template.html@6:0, Unexpected closing tag "ng-template". It may happen when the tag has already been closed by another tag. For more info see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#closing-elements-that-have-implied-end-tags ("
<div>class="pokedex-header"</div>
</->
[ERROR ->]</ng-template>"): ng:///HeaderComponent/template.html@7:0`

- Let's work through these, one by one.

ERROR 1: Data.service

NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[DataService -> HttpClient -> HttpClient]: 
    NullInjectorError: No provider for HttpClient!

    - What happens if I Google this? 
    - Stack Overflow forum suggests I add `imports: [HttpClientTestingModule]` to configuration. Have imported `import { HttpClientTestingModule } from '@angular/common/http/testing';` I think it works... 
    - Going to run `ng test` in terminal again
    - YAY! ERROR 1 has gone! üéâüéâüéâ '1 SUCCESS'! üéâüéâüéâ 

ERROR 2: Pokemon-list.component

NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError(DynamicTestModule)[DataService -> HttpClient -> HttpClient]: 
    NullInjectorError: No provider for HttpClient!

    - Same ERROR as above, so will try same approach.
    - IT WORKED!!! YAY! üéâüéâüéâ '2 SUCCESS'! üéâüéâüéâ üòÇ

ERROR 3: Unexpected ng closing tag

    - In answering ERROR 1, a bug was detailed in the terminal which I think corresponds to ERROR 3. It's fixed! I just tidied up the `<>s`, moved a class to inside a div and deleted a `-`. (üéâüéâüéâ)


Now, it's failing in a new way. Let's investigate. 

ERROR 4: Header Component

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createEmbeddedView')

    - Let's Google this error.
    - I've added renderTemplate to 'header.component.ts' - not sure whether to add 'OnInit' and 'AfterInit', too... 
    - But is compiled successfully and it says the test is a SUCCESS! üéâüéâüéâ

- Will save for today and come back to tomorrow. 

## Process (12/4/23) 

### PM

- Basking in the glow of my success yesterday (üòÇ), I will now attempt to pick up where I left off.
- Am thinking that perhaps the best place to start is by watching this Error Handling in Angular video to see if I can work out why it isn't connecting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e03EHZIVJtM

## Process (13/4/23) 

### AM

- Going to start with the headline problem, as otherwise I won't be able to see what I'm doing.
- Have looked on Stack Overflow and it looks like I can see errors in more detail by typing F12 in my browser (Developer Tools) - will give this a go
- Ok, couldn't get F12 to work, but did see that I needed to add `<app-root></app-root>` to the index.html file, so that's good.
- Screen is still blank so will keep investigating. it says 'Listening on port 5500', but this is differrent to port 4200 that I've been using earlier. 
- Only thing in the console is: 'Hot Module Replacement disabled, Live Reloading enabled, Progress disabled, Overlay enabled.' - going to look this up. I've installed Bootstrap in the package.json (think I may have deleted this earlier...)
- At the moment, I'm going through my code line-by-line to see if there are any bits I've deleted/left out from the original code I pulled from CodeWeavers.
- Ok, I've created a settings.json file in the .vscode file to try to change the Live Server settings so it goes live on port 4200.
- I've also just seen this new ERROR message in the console of localhost:4200 page: 'Angular is running in development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable production mode.' I don't think I want to deploy yet...
- Going back to the Angular docs to check I've set everything up correctly. 
- Ooh new ERRORS! OK - let's set them out 1 by 1:

ERROR 1: 'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)' http://localhost:4200/app/header/

ERROR 2: 'Refused to execute http://localhost:4200/app/header/ as script because "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" was given and its Content-Type is not a script MIME type.'

ERROR 3: 'Error: The selector "app-root" did not match any elements'

ERROR 4: 'Error: The selector "app-root" did not match any elements'

INFORMATION POINT: '[webpack-dev-server] Server started: Hot Module Replacement disabled, Live Reloading enabled, Progress disabled, Overlay enabled.'

So there are a few things to look at. I'll start with ERROR 1.

1. ERROR 1: I've now got Angular listening on port 5500 (`ng serve --port 5500`) I can open it in a new browser tab by adding `ng serve --port 5500 --open`

 - It still has the ERROR 404 (Not Found) - so, now I know it's listening on the right port, maybe there's something wrong with how I'm pointing to the styles.scss and main.ts files?
 - Have just double-checked json settings to make sure any instances of port 4200 have been changed to port 5500
 - I deleted the styles and main links from the HTML and all the ERRORS disappeared. Still not showing anything on the page, though. Will keep reading Angular docs and looking at their example.
 
- VERY EXCITED: I just got 'Understanding Angular' to appear on my Live Server screen (yay!)
- I put that in the 'app.component.html' file, so perhaps I need to focus there?
- If I go to each of the html files of header, app and index and paste them into the URL bar, they all appear as expected. Is it becuase I'm not linking them with something like React that they're not showing up?
- Am looking up examples of React used with Angular and Bootstrap. Have found a couple of repos I think could be helpful.

### PM

- I've tried looking at examples on GitHub and seeing if there's a different way to do this (e.g. https://github.com/dadu0699/Pokedex/tree/master/src). Have run into some ERRORS, which I will try to fix (maybe I could use ng test?) Might make the errors a bit clearer 
- ERROR now reads: 'An unhandled exception occurred: error TS18003: No inputs were found in config file '/Users/marthabennett/Documents/Coding/CodeWeavers/Pokedex/fed-graduate-role/tsconfig.spec.json'. Specified 'include' paths were '["src/**/*.spec.ts","src/**/*.d.ts"]' and 'exclude' paths were '["./out-tsc/spec"]'.

- I've looked on GitHub and seen that I may need to update the global CLI (using `npm i @angular/cli -g)
- I now get a new ERROR: Ms-MacBook-Pro:fed-graduate-role marthabennett$ npm i @angular/cli -g

4. npm cache clean
5. npm cache clean --force
6. npm cache verify
7. Uninstalling node and re installing
8. Changing permission settings on AppData/Roaming/npm
9. Deleting files in AppData/Roaming/npm/nodemodules
10. I may not be running as an admin (this happened earlier in the week I think?) - will look up how to do this. 

- Looking at option 10, I've researched how to run VSCode as an admin, but right-clicking on the terminal isn't providing me with an option to do this. Looking in greater detail on Stack Overflow, someone has commented saying 'this only works if you close all instances of VSCode before'. What does this mean? Will Google. 
- It doesn't say anything about administrator prompts, it just says its installed it (something to do with Docker, perhaps?)
- I will try the approach I used earlier (`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- This seems to have worked (tiny party! üéâ)
- Now, I will run `ng serve --port 5500 --open` and `ng test` again
- That didn't work. ERROR: 'This command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace.' Maybe I'm in the wrong file/at the wrong level?
- Will try in 'fed-graduate-role' file. 
- Ok, it's listening on Port 5500, a few ERRORS, same as before. I will now try to run `ng test`, now that I hopefully have permission...
- Ohhhh - same ERROR as before. 
- 'An unhandled exception occurred: error TS18003: No inputs were found in config file '/Users/marthabennett/Documents/Coding/CodeWeavers/Pokedex/fed-graduate-role/tsconfig.spec.json'. Specified 'include' paths were '["src/**/*.spec.ts","src/**/*.d.ts"]' and 'exclude' paths were '["./out-tsc/spec"]'.

See "/private/var/folders/56/y3ypz80117d3l86wh3nkj9wr0000gn/T/ng-Y8YnJP/angular-errors.log" for further details.'
- Going to look up just the first bit of the ERROR, break it down
- Stack Overflow says this: 'TypeScript expects there to be at least one TypeScript file in the folder in order to compile.

To fix the error, add an empty typescript file to the typescript scripts folder (the location of your tsconfig file).'
- Will try this!
- Ok, I've added an 'empty.ts' file to the same level as the tsconfig.json - let's see if this works!
- It still won't run 'ng test' 
- So, back to trying 'ng serve --port 5500 --open`
- Going to go through ERRORS as I can see them in the terminal:

Ok Jos√©. Going for a cup of tea, then going to work through ERRORS one by one. 

Just before I go: have I tried `ng build` yet? Same ERRORS as before! Time for a break!

- Going through ERRORS from yesterday, one by one 

## Process (18/4/23) 

### AM

- Looking at how I would run tests if I could üëÄ
- Could use react testing library using Jest (runs in Node; not great for e2e tests)
- Create test files next to the components you are testing e.g. `App.test.js` and `App.js` in the same folder
- Command Line usually `npm test`, in this case: `ng test` (`npm test a` to run all tests - does this also work for `ng test a`? ü§î)
- To write a test: create an `it()` or `test()` block with the name of the test and its code (Jest has an in-built `expect()` global function)

- Example of a basic test: 

    `import sum from './sum';

    it('sums numbers', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);
  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);
    });`
- I've create an `app.component.test.js` file with this basic smoke test inside:
    `import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import AppComponent from './app.component';

    it('renders without crashing', () => {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    ReactDOM.render(<AppComponent />, div);
    });`

This is just to see if the component renders without throwing. 
- Could use React testing library to test components in isolation (recommended to use this with `jest-dom` for improved assertions)
- To install, run: `npm install --save @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom` (`ng ...` ? ü§î)
- Maybe need to initialise a test environment first (add a `src/setupTests.js` - this will be automatically executed before running my tests)
- Do I need to use a CI server (e.g. Travis/Circle CI? ü§î)
